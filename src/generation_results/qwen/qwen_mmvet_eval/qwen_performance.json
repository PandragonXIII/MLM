They are standing in front of a fireplace and a window, with a dog at their feet. The painting is known for its use of perspective, which gives the impression that the figures are simultaneously inside and outside the frame. The painting is also notable for its use of light and shadow, and for its intricate details, such as the pattern on the woman's dress and the pattern on the curtain hanging in the background. The painting is considered a masterpiece of early Netherlandish painting, and is housed in the National Gallery in London."
