The coefficient of the variable x is 1 and the coefficient of the variable y is -3. To add these two numbers, we need to add their digits in order. So we get:\n\n1 + -3 = -2\n\nThen we subtract the result from each side of the equation by the same amount. This gives us:\n\nx - 2 = 6\n\nNext, we multiply the coefficients of the terms on the left-hand side of the equation. In this case, the coefficient of the term x^2 is 1 and the coefficient of the term 3y is -1. So we get:\n\n1 x 2 = 2\n-1 x 3 = -3\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first equation gives us:\n\n2 - 3 = -1\n\nFinally, we can solve for the variable by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable. In this case, the coefficient of the variable x is 1, so we divide both sides by 1 to get:\n\nx = 2\n\nTherefore, the total price for a bottle of Merlot and a bottle of Cabernet shown in"

What is the price difference between diesel and regular gasoline?\nThe price difference between diesel and regular gasoline varies depending on several factors such as the location, the brand, and the type of vehicle you are using.\n\nIn general, diesel fuel tends to be more expensive than regular gasoline because it is more energy-dense, which means that it contains more energy per gallon than regular gasoline. This makes it more expensive to produce, transport, and refine.\n\nHowever, the price difference between diesel and regular gasoline can vary significantly depending on where you live. In some areas, diesel fuel may be cheaper than regular gasoline due to differences in local demand and supply patterns.\n\nIt's worth noting that many diesel engines are designed to operate on diesel fuel, so they are typically more fuel efficient than gasoline engines. However, diesel fuel can also be more expensive to maintain due to its higher sulfur content, which can lead to increased emissions and engine wear.\n\n2. Can I use regular gasoline in a diesel car?\nIt is generally not recommended to use regular gasoline in a diesel car, as it may not be compatible with the engine's fuel system. Diesel fuel has a higher viscosity than regular gasoline, which means it requires a different kind of fuel system to burn efficiently.\n\nUsing regular gasoline in a"
