The graph below shows the long-term international migration to the UK from 1999 to 2008. The graph shows that the number of immigrants to the UK has been steadily increasing over the years, with a peak in 2008. The graph also shows that the number of emigrants from the UK has been steadily decreasing over the years, with a peak in 2004. The graph is a useful tool for understanding the trends in migration to and from the UK over the past decade."
