In this case, a = 2, b = -5, and c = 4. Substituting these values into the formula gives us:\n\nx = (-(-5 \u00b1 \u221a((-5)^2 - 4(2)(4))) / (2(2))\n\nx = (-5 \u00b1 \u221a(25 + 16) / 4)\n\nx = (-5 \u00b1 \u221a29 / 4)\n\nTherefore, there are two solutions to the equation, x = -3 and x = 5.", "2x + 3 = 5\n\nThe equation above represents the solution of the equation 2x + 3 = 5, which is equal to x = 1.\n\nThis equation can be solved by dividing both sides by 2 to get 1x + 3 = 5, which simplifies to x = 1.

The number is also displayed as a list of individual digits, with each digit represented by a row and column in the table.\n\nTo find the pattern of how the \"X\" operator is redefined, one could look for repeated or alternating sequences of two digits in the table. For example, one might notice that every second row (counting from left to right) has a digit in the tens place, while every fourth row has a digit in the hundreds place. This suggests that the \"X\" operator is being used to multiply each digit in the tens place by a factor of ten.
