The table also shows the marital status of adult Americans in two of those years.\n\nOverall, the rate of marriage was higher in the earlier years than in later years. For example, in 1970, the marriage rate was 8.1 per 1,000 people, while in 2000, it was 6.4 per 1,000 people. Similarly, the divorce rate was higher in the early years, peaking at 2.9 per 1,000 people in 1981, before declining to 2.5 per 1,000 people in 2000.\n\nNotably, there was a significant drop in the number of adults who were married or widowed in both 1970 and 1981. In 1970, 66.4% of adults were married or widowed, compared to 63.5% in 1981. This may indicate a shift towards more single-person households.\n\nIn terms of marital status in 1979 and 1980, there were fewer adults who were married or divorced, while the number of adults who were widowed remained stable. This suggests that people were less likely to get married or divorced during these years, while the number of widows did not change significantly.\n\nOverall, these statistics suggest that the rates of marriage and divorce in the USA changed significantly over the period from 1970 to 2000.

The percentage that salary contributes to total income depends on the specific job and industry. However, in general, salaries make up a significant portion of an individual's overall income. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), in 2019, median weekly earnings for full-time wage and salary workers were $861. This represents 49% of the national median weekly earnings of $1,787.\n2. The percentage of income that comes from salary can vary widely depending on factors such as job type, location, and industry. For example, according to the BLS, the median weekly earnings for employees in the healthcare and social assistance industry were $1,045 in 2019, while those in the retail trade industry earned just $499 per week.\n3. In some cases, income from salary may be a much larger percentage of an individual's overall income than the national median. This is especially true for top executives and highly paid professionals, who can earn millions of dollars per year.\n4. Additionally, it's worth noting that there are many other sources of income beyond salary, such as investments, self-employment, and government benefits. Therefore, it's important to consider all sources of income when determining an individual's overall financial situation.\n5. It's also worth noting that the amount of income from salary can have tax implications, as salary is subject to federal, state, and local taxes. Therefore, it's important to understand how much of an individual's salary is being taxed and how much is being taken home after taxes."}], "v1_85": [{"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/MLM/temp/denoised_img/177_denoised_250times.jpg", "How many birds are there?"], "generation": "The image shows two people in a Chinese-style setting with a red background and ornate decorations.

The graph is divided into three sections: 1999 to 2001, 2001 to 2003, and 2003 to 2008. The data for each section is represented by different colors, with blue representing a decrease in migration, green representing a slight increase in migration, and orange representing an increase in migration.\n\nOverall, the graph shows a steady increase in international migration to the United Kingdom over the years. The highest number of migrants was recorded in 2003, with a total of 541,000 people migrating to the UK from other countries. This number decreased slightly in 2004 and 2005, but then increased again in 2006 and 2007, reaching 477,000 and 531,000 migrants respectively.

There is no cure for Parkinson's disease, but medications and other treatments can help manage symptoms.\n2. Levodopa/Carbidopa: Levodopa/carbidopa is a medication used to treat Parkinson's disease. It works by increasing the levels of dopamine in the brain, which helps improve motor function. Levodopa is converted into dopamine in the brain, while carbidopa is a transport inhibitor that increases the concentration of levodopa in the blood. This combination is effective in controlling symptoms of Parkinson's disease.\n3. Deep Brain Stimulation: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a surgical procedure used to treat Parkinson's disease. In this procedure, electrodes are implanted in the brain to deliver electrical impulses to targeted areas. These impulses can help regulate abnormal brain activity and reduce symptoms of Parkinson's disease. DBS is typically reserved for patients who have not responded to other treatments.\n4. Brain Wave Training: Brain wave training is a type of therapy that involves using audio recordings to help train the brain to produce certain patterns of brain waves. This technique is often used to treat anxiety, depression, and insomnia, but it may also be helpful in managing symptoms of Parkinson's disease.\n5. Physical Therapy: Physical therapy is an important part of treatment for Parkinson's disease. It can help improve mobility, reduce stiffness, and improve balance and coordination. Physical therapy may include exercises, stretches, and other activities designed to strengthen muscles and improve flexibility.\n6. Speech Therapy: Speech therapy may be beneficial for people with Parkinson's disease who experience problems with speech and swallowing. Speech therapists can help patients develop strategies to improve communication skills, such as speaking"}, {"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/MLM/temp/denoised_img/74_denoised_050times.jpg", "What is this disease (give short introduction) and how to treat it?"], "generation": "This is the headquarters of a large company that produces various types of equipment, including machinery and industrial products.

The most common antibiotics used to treat tuberculosis are isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide. These antibiotics work together to kill the bacteria and prevent them from reproducing.\nIn some cases, surgery may also be necessary to remove infected parts of the body. The treatment duration varies depending on the severity of the infection, the patient's age and overall health, and other factors.\nPrevention of tuberculosis includes improving public health measures such as vaccination programs, improving sanitation and hygiene, and reducing poverty and inequality.

It appears that there is a significant difference in the amount of water used per person in the two countries. The graph shows that water use is lower in the second country, with a much lower water use per person. This could indicate that the second country has more efficient ways of using water or that it has less access to water resources. It could also suggest that the second country is more conscious of water conservation and sustainability.\n\nWater is an essential resource for all living things, and its scarcity and pollution are major issues affecting many regions of the world. Water resources are vulnerable to various pressures such as population growth, urbanization, industrialization, deforestation, and climate change. The demand for water is increasing due to the growing population, urbanization, and economic development, leading to competition among different sectors for this scarce resource. This competition can lead to conflicts between users, mismanagement, and overuse, which can result in severe water shortages and environmental degradation.\n\nTo address these challenges, it is crucial to develop sustainable water management practices that promote conservation, efficiency, and equitable distribution of water resources. One strategy is to implement integrated water resource management (IWRM) approaches, which involve coordinating multiple uses of water, including agriculture, industry, energy production, and ecosystem services. This approach recognizes the interdependence between these uses and the need to balance their competing demands while minimizing waste, pollution, and environmental impacts. IWRM also promotes public awareness and participatory approaches to engage stakeholders and communities in decision-making processes.\n\nMoreover, it is important to adopt water-saving technologies and best practices in agriculture, industry, and domestic sectors to reduce water usage and waste. Water-saving measures such as drip irrigation, low-flow faucets, and greywater reuse can help conserve water resources while also reducing costs and energy consumption. In addition, water quality management practices are essential to prevent pollution and protect aquatic ecosystems.\n\nIn conclusion, water is a critical resource for human survival, economic development, and environmental health.

The graphs show trends in water use over time in two different countries.\n\nOverall, the information in the book suggests that water consumption varies widely between countries, with some using significantly more than others. Agriculture is the largest user of water in most countries, followed by industry and then household purposes. The trend in water use has been increasing in both countries over time, but at different rates."}, {"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/MLM/temp/denoised_img/92_denoised_100times.jpg", "The graph and table below give information about water use worldwide and water consumption in two different countries.\n\nSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.\n\nYou should write at least 150 words."], "generation": "The graph shows the amount of water used worldwide and in India. The world uses around 40% more water than India, with China and Russia using the most water out of all countries. The United States uses the most water per capita, at 2,176 cubic meters, while Burkina Faso uses the least, at 83 cubic meters. India uses a significant amount of water for agriculture, accounting for almost half of its total use. However, the amount of water used for irrigation in India is much less than that in other countries such as the United States and China.\n\nThe table provides a breakdown of water consumption in two countries, the United States and China. The United States consumes 9,085 cu ft of water per person each year, while China consumes 6,972 cu ft per person annually. This means that the United States uses significantly more water per person than China, which has a population of over four times that of the United States. Additionally, the United States uses more water for agriculture than China does. This indicates that the United States is more water-intensive than China, particularly in terms of agricultural usage."}], "v1_211": [{"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/MLM/temp/denoised_img/94_denoised_050times.jpg", "The chart below shows the amount spent on six consumer goods in four European countries.\n\nWrite a report for a university lecturer describing the information shown below.\n\nYou should write at least 150 words."], "generation": "1.

Here are some fun and engaging activities for children to do after snapping their fingers:\n\n1. Imitate sounds: After snapping their fingers, kids can imitate different sounds such as cuckoos, squawks, or other animal sounds they have heard. They can also make up their own sounds and see how many they can imitate.\n2. Play rhythm games: Kids can play rhythm games such as clapping, stomping, or tapping on objects to keep the beat. This activity helps them develop their auditory skills and rhythm sense.\n3. Sing songs: Singing songs is an excellent way to develop language skills. Kids can sing simple songs such as \"Row, Row, Row Your Boat\" or \"Bah, Bah, Bah.\"\n4. Play with action words: Action words such as \"jump,\" \"hop,\" \"crawl,\" and \"run\" can help kids develop their physical skills while developing their language skills.\n5. Draw or color: Drawing or coloring can help kids develop their fine motor skills and creativity while promoting language development.\n6. Storytelling: Kids can use their imagination to create stories with their toys or action figures. Encourage them to use descriptive language to paint vivid pictures in their minds.\n\nThese activities not only promote language development but also help kids build their cognitive, physical, and social-emotional skills. Engaging in these activities can be fun for kids and help them develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills as well."}, {"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/MLM/temp/denoised_img/133_denoised_250times.jpg", "What should kids do after snap fingers?"], "generation": "Children should be encouraged to participate in outdoor activities, such as gardening or playing with their friends in the backyard.
