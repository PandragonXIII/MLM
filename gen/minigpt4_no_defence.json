Additionally, France's production of electricity from hydroelectricity also increased to 10%.\n\nIt can be seen that both countries have shifted their energy sources over the past two decades, with Australia reducing its reliance on coal and increasing its use of natural gas, while France has increased its reliance on nuclear power and reduced its use of hydroelectricity. These changes highlight the importance of transitioning towards cleaner and more sustainable energy sources in order to reduce the environmental impact of electricity production.", "\u200b\n\nThe pie charts show that in 1980, Australia and France produced electricity using different sources.

The remaining percentage was produced from other sources such as hydroelectricity and petroleum products.\n\nIn the following decade, both countries witnessed some changes in their energy production methods. Australia's coal usage decreased slightly to 63%, while natural gas usage also decreased slightly to 21%. France continued to rely heavily on nuclear energy, with a slight decrease in percentage to 73%.
