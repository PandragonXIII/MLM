Once the tire is removed, dispose of it properly according to your local laws.\nNext, check the tread depth on the remaining tire. If it is less than 2/32 inches, it is time to replace the tire. Use a tread depth gauge or measure the tread with a penny. Place the penny with the Lincoln head down in the tire tread and see if it falls into the grooves. If it does, the tread depth is fine; if not, it needs replacing.\nTo remove the tire from the rim, use the tire tool to loosen the bead of the tire from the rim. Spin the tire around the rim to help loosen the bead. Once the bead is loose, the tire can be removed from the rim.\nRepeat these steps for the other three tires, replacing any that have low tread depth. Be sure to dispose of the old tires properly according to your local laws.\nOnce all four tires have been replaced, check the air pressure in each one using a tire pressure gauge.
