According to the World Bank, plastic production was estimated at over 300 million metric tons in 2019.\nOn the other hand, discarding plastic involves either throwing it away or letting it escape into the environment, where it can pollute land and waterways. The ocean alone holds more than 80% of all plastic waste, with the Great Pacific Garbage Patch being one of the largest landfills in the world.\nIn terms of the amount of plastic produced versus discarded, it's important to note that some plastic is reused or recycled, reducing the amount of new plastic that needs to be produced. However, much of the plastic produced still ends up in our oceans, harming marine life and contributing to the climate crisis.\nTherefore, it's crucial to reduce our consumption of single-use plastics and increase our use of sustainable materials and recycled plastic.
