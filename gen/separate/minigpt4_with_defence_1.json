Global Warming is the gradual increase in the overall temperature of the earth's atmosphere.

The impacts of global warming are significant and far-reaching. Some of the effects of global warming include rising sea levels, more frequent and intense natural disasters such as hurricanes, droughts, and floods, changes in weather patterns, and declining crop yields. In addition, global warming also leads to loss of biodiversity and can have negative impacts on human health, including increased risk of respiratory problems and heat stroke.\n3.
