The table provides a comparison of the number of passengers carried per year, the number of stations, and the number of kilometers of track.

This is due to the extensive network of underground lines and the high frequency of trains. The city also has the highest number of stations, with over 270 stations.\n\nParis has the second highest number of passengers carried per year, with over 1.2 billion passengers in 2019. The city has a relatively small number of stations, with around 300 stations.\n\nNew York has the third highest number of passengers carried per year, with over 1.1 billion passengers in 2019. The city has a large number of stations, with over 470 stations.\n\nTokyo has the fourth highest number of passengers carried per year, with over 1.0 billion passengers in 2019. The city has a relatively small number of stations, with around 300 stations.\n\nMoscow has the fifth highest number of passengers carried per year, with over 900 million passengers in 2019. The city has a relatively small number of stations, with around 200 stations.\n\nWashington D.C. has the sixth highest number of passengers carried per year, with over 800 million passengers in 2019. The city has a relatively small number of stations, with around 100 stations.\n\nOverall, the table shows that London has the highest number of passengers carried per year, the highest number of stations, and the longest track length.
