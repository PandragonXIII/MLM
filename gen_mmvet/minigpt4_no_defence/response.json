According to a recent study, global water consumption has increased by about 40% in the past 20 years. The study showed that the majority of the increase in water consumption was due to urban areas, which have seen significant population growth. Urban areas accounted for more than 70% of global water consumption, while agriculture accounted for about 20%.\n\nThe United States is one of the countries with the highest water consumption in the world, using an average of 95 gallons per person per day. The United States is followed by Australia, which consumes an average of 86 gallons per person per day. On the other hand, countries like China, India, and Brazil consume much less water per person per day, at around 15 gallons per person per day.\n\nOverall, the trend towards increasing water consumption in urban areas is expected to continue due to population growth, urbanization, and increasing demand for water-intensive industries such as agriculture, manufacturing, and energy production. In contrast, the trend towards decreasing water consumption in rural areas will likely continue due to declining population, urbanization, and changing lifestyles and consumption patterns.\n\nDespite the global increase in water consumption, many countries still face water scarcity challenges, particularly in the agricultural sector. Water scarcity is also a major concern in developing countries, where access to clean water is limited, and competition for water resources among different sectors is high. To address these challenges, governments and organizations are investing in water management systems and programs aimed at improving water efficiency, reducing water loss, and increasing the use of alternative water sources such as rainwater harvesting, wastewater reuse, and desalination."}, {"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/mm-vet-data/images218/209.jpg", "The graph and table below give information about water use worldwide and water consumption in two different countries.\n\nSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.\n\nYou should write at least 150 words."], "generation": "The graph shows the amount of water used per person in two different countries.

It has a long history of development that can be traced back to the Middle Ages. The village was initially developed as a small agricultural community, with most of its residents working on farms or in related industries such as milling and weaving. In the 1800s, the population began to increase as people moved to the area to work in factories that were being established nearby.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution had a significant impact on Chorleywood, as many of its residents worked in factories producing goods such as wool and cloth. By the mid-19th century, the village had become a small industrial town with around 1,500 residents. However, this development was short-lived, as many factories closed down due to competition from other towns and the decline of the wool industry.\n\nIn the latter half of the 20th century, the village underwent significant development as it became a dormitory suburb for London. Many of its residents commute to the city for work, and the population has increased dramatically since the 1960s. Today, Chorleywood has a population of around 4,500 and continues to grow as a popular place to live for those who work in London. Despite the development, the village still retains its rural character, with many residents owning horses and enjoying the surrounding countryside."}], "v1_129": [{"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/mm-vet-data/images218/129.jpg", "On the right desk, what is to the left of the laptop?

There are different types of gasoline available, including regular, mid-grade, and premium.\nRegular gasoline typically contains 87 octane and is suitable for most vehicles. Mid-grade gasoline contains 89 octane and is recommended for vehicles that require higher performance. Premium gasoline contains 91 octane and is recommended for high-performance vehicles that require better fuel efficiency.\nTo calculate how many gallons of gasoline you can get with $50, you need to know the price per gallon of each type of gasoline in your area. Let's assume that the regular gasoline costs $3.50 per gallon, mid-grade gasoline costs $3.60 per gallon, and premium gasoline costs $3.70 per gallon. This means that one gallon of regular gasoline costs $3.50, one gallon of mid-grade gasoline costs $3.60, and one gallon of premium gasoline costs $3.70.\nTherefore, if you want to buy one gallon of regular gasoline, you would need to pay $3.50. To buy two gallons of regular gasoline, you would need to pay $7.00 (2 \u00d7 $3.50). To buy one gallon of mid-grade gasoline, you would need to pay $3.60.

Therefore, it is recommended that both countries continue to explore alternative energy sources and invest in renewable energy technologies, such as wind, solar, and geothermal, to further reduce their dependence on coal."}, {"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/mm-vet-data/images218/214.jpg", "The pie charts below show units of electricity production by fuel source in Australia and France in 1980 and 2000.\n\nSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.\n\nYou should write at least 150 words."], "generation": "1.

In 1980, coal was the dominant fuel source for electricity production in both countries, accounting for over 60% of the total units produced in Australia and more than 75% in France. Nuclear power was a significant contributor to electricity production in both countries, with France relying heavily on nuclear power to meet its electricity needs, accounting for over 40% of the total units produced. Gas and oil were also used as fuel sources for electricity production, but their contributions were relatively small compared to coal and nuclear power.\n\nIn 2000, there were significant changes in the fuel sources used for electricity production in both countries. Coal still remained the dominant fuel source, but its share of the total units produced had decreased slightly in both countries. Nuclear power had become an even more significant contributor to electricity production, with France relying on it even more heavily than before. Gas and oil had become increasingly important fuel sources, accounting for over 30% of the total units produced in both countries.\n\nIn conclusion, the pie charts demonstrate that coal was the dominant fuel source for electricity production in both Australia and France in 1980 and 2000. However, there were significant changes in the fuel sources used over time, with nuclear power becoming an increasingly important contributor to electricity production and gas and oil playing a larger role in both countries."}], "v1_99": [{"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/mm-vet-data/images218/099.jpg", "Which are producers in this food web?"], "generation": "The animals shown in the image are producers in this food web.
