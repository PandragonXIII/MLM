In some cases, crop rotation and natural predators, such as ladybugs, can also be used to manage the disease. It is important to identify and treat corn earworm early in the season to minimize the impact on the crop yield."], "v1_34": ["Before cutting herbs, sausage, and mushrooms, you should make sure to have all the necessary utensils ready.
