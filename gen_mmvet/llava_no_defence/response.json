In contrast, France's electricity production has remained relatively stable, with a strong reliance on nuclear power."}], "v1_49": [{"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/mm-vet-data/images218/049.jpg", "What are the appliances in the kitchen in this floorplan?"], "generation": "In the kitchen, there is a sink and a refrigerator."}, {"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/mm-vet-data/images218/049.jpg", "What are the appliances in the kitchen in this floorplan?"], "generation": "In the kitchen, there is a sink and a refrigerator."}, {"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/mm-vet-data/images218/049.jpg", "What are the appliances in the kitchen in this floorplan?"], "generation": "In the kitchen, there is a sink and a refrigerator."}], "v1_107": [{"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/mm-vet-data/images218/107.jpg", "Is this airplane taking off or landing?"], "generation": "The airplane is taking off from the runway."}, {"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/mm-vet-data/images218/107.jpg", "Is this airplane taking off or landing?"], "generation": "The airplane is taking off from the runway."}, {"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/mm-vet-data/images218/107.jpg", "Is this airplane taking off or landing?"], "generation": "The airplane is taking off from the runway."}], "v1_189": [{"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/mm-vet-data/images218/189.jpg", "What is this disease (give short introduction) and how to treat it?"], "generation": "The disease in the image is a fungal infection, specifically a leaf spot caused by the fungus Cercospora.
