Twenty years later, in 2000, the total electricity production increased to 170 units, with coal still being the major source, accounting for a substantial increase to 130 units. However, the shares of oil and natural gas declined to 36 and 2 units respectively. Hydro power remained unchanged at 2 units.\n\nTurning to France, in 1980, the electricity production landscape was more diverse with no single source dominating. Nuclear power, natural gas, and coal contributed similar portions, with 25 units each, while oil supplied 15 units and hydro power 5 units out of a total of 90 units. By 2000, there was a significant shift towards nuclear power, which skyrocketed to 126 units out of a total production of 180 units. This dramatic increase underscores France's heavy investment in nuclear energy. Other sources maintained their production (25 units for natural gas, 2 units each for coal and oil), except hydro power, which wasn't depicted in the chart for 2000.\n\nOverall, while Australia continued to rely mostly on coal with an increased total electricity production, France made a strategic move towards nuclear energy, becoming the dominant fuel source by 2000.

Black knot is caused by the fungus Apiosporina morbosa (also known as Dibotryon morbosum).\n\nShort introduction to Black Knot:\n\nBlack knot is a fungal disease characterized by the formation of swollen, black galls on the branches and twigs. The galls start as small, olive-green swellings and gradually become larger and harder, eventually turning black. As the knots mature, they can girdle and kill the affected branches, leading to reduced fruit production, weakened trees, and increased susceptibility to other diseases and pest infestations.\n\nTreatment for Black Knot:\n\n1. Pruning: Infected branches should be pruned out during the dormant season, cutting at least 6 to 8 inches below the knot to ensure all fungal material is removed. It's important to disinfect pruning tools between cuts with a solution of bleach or alcohol to prevent spreading the fungus.\n\n2. Sanitation: Pruned material should be immediately removed from the area and destroyed by burning, burying, or hot composting to eliminate sources of new infections.\n\n3. Chemical Control: Fungicides can be applied as a protective measure early in the season or when new growth is emerging. Effective control usually requires multiple applications according to a specific schedule that may depend on the local climate and the particular trees being treated.\n\n4. Preventive Measures: Avoiding plant stress through proper watering, fertilization, and care can help reduce the susceptibility of trees to black knot. When planting new trees, selecting resistant varieties can also help prevent the disease.\n\n5. Monitoring: Regular inspection of the trees, especially in early spring, for signs of black knot can lead to early detection and prompt management.\n\nIt's important to follow local guidelines and regulations when applying fungicides and to seek advice from a professional arborist or local plant disease extension service for precise treatment protocols in your area."}, {"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/mm-vet-data/images218/195.jpg", "What is this disease (give short introduction) and how to treat it?"], "generation": "The image you have provided shows a plant with a type of gall, specifically a type of deformation that can be caused by various parasites, including insects, mites, nematodes, fungi, or bacteria.

These galls provide the larvae with both protection and nourishment. One well-known example is the oak gall, created by the larvae of gall wasps.\n\nTo treat plant galls:\n\n1. Prevention: Start with resistant plant varieties if available and maintain good plant health to decrease susceptibility to pests and diseases.\n2.

Over this period, Chorleywood experienced significant growth and infrastructural changes, shaping it into the village it is today.\n\nFrom 1868 to 1883, the initial development of Chorleywood was modest, focusing primarily on the central area surrounding Chorleywood Station. A network of main roads, crucial for establishing connectivity and facilitating growth, was constructed during this initial phase.\n\nThe period between 1883 and 1922 saw an expansion of development branching from the central area towards the northeastern and southwestern parts of the village. Several parallel roads appear to follow a linear pattern of growth, indicating a planned approach to social housing and public spaces.\n\nSubstantial growth took place from 1922 to 1970, with the emergence of densely developed residential areas. These developments filled the space between the initial northeastern growth and the main road to the west, ultimately leading to a more cohesive and interconnected village structure. Chorleywood Park and the accompanying Golf course also appear to have been established during this period, providing recreational facilities for the village's inhabitants.\n\nFrom 1970 onwards, the village saw the introduction of the motorway, contributing to an even greater connectivity to the broader region and facilitating a spike in commuter population. Simultaneously, more development can be seen spreading outward from the main hub in a more dispersed manner, particularly to the south and west, indicating a trend towards suburban expansion.\n\nThe last phase, between 1970 and 1994, is marked by a significant amount of new development especially to the west and south of the railroad and motorway. The construction of the railway in 1909 undoubtedly catalyzed previous growth phases, but the motorway's introduction seems to have spurred an even faster pace of development.\n\nOverall, the map shows that Chorleywood has grown from a small village center into a more extensive residential area with leisure facilities and enhanced connectivity. The infrastructural advancements, particularly with transportation, have played a central role in shaping the village's development across more than a century."}, {"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/mm-vet-data/images218/215.jpg", "Chorleywood is a village near London whose population has increased steadily since the middle of the nineteenth century.

The map provided indicates four significant stages in the development of Chorleywood by showing distinct patterns of growth for the periods of 1868-1883, 1883-1922, 1922-1970, and 1970-1994.\n\nFrom 1868 to 1883, Chorleywood experienced its initial expansion which is predominantly to the east of the railway that was later built in 1909. The main road constructed during this period appears as the backbone for the later development of the village.\n\nBetween 1883 and 1922, further growth can be observed with additional areas of development surfacing to the southeast and west of the initial expansion. It is evident that the construction of the railway had a significant impact, facilitating easier access and contributing to the spread of the village.\n\nSubsequent development from 1922 to 1970 shows Chorleywood extensively expanding southwest, while the areas northeast of the main road begin to fill in as well. The village's growth embraced the arrival of the motorway in 1970, which introduced a new transportation axis.\n\nThe most recent phase of development from 1970 to 1994 reveals a continued outward spread, particularly westward along the motorway and south of the railway station. Additionally, a new patch of development is noticeable to the northwest of the main road, reflecting an ongoing suburban proliferation.\n\nThroughout the examined period, Chorleywood Park and Golf course remains a stable green area amidst the village's development, serving as a recreational focal point for residents. Chorleywood Station, situated centrally along the railway line, likely served to anchor the growth and connectivity of the village.\n\nIn conclusion, the evolution of Chorleywood from 1868 to 1994 illustrates a robust pattern of expansion influenced by key transport infrastructures such as the railway and motorway. The development appears strategic, radiating from transport hubs and preserving green spaces like the park and golf course for community use."}, {"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/mm-vet-data/images218/215.jpg", "Chorleywood is a village near London whose population has increased steadily since the middle of the nineteenth century.

If making from scratch, combine flour, butter, a pinch of salt, and water to form the dough. Divide it into two halves, one for the bottom crust and one for the lattice top.\n\n3. **Roll out the bottom crust:**\n   - Roll one half of the dough to fit the pie dish with a slight overhang. Transfer it to the pie dish and press it into the bottom and sides.\n\n4. **Add the filling:**\n   - Pour the prepared fruit filling into the pie crust.\n\n5. **Prepare the lattice top:**\n   - Roll out the second half of the dough and cut it into strips.\n   - Weave the strips over and under each other on top of the pie to create a lattice pattern. Trim any excess dough from the edges.\n\n6. **Seal and crimp:**\n   - Press the edges of the lattice strips into the bottom pie crust edge. Crimp the edges for a decorative look.\n\n7. **Glaze and sprinkle (optional):**\n   - Brush the top of the pie with an egg wash (a beaten egg with a bit of water or milk) for a golden finish.\n   - Sprinkle sugar over the lattice to give it a nice crunch and sweetness.\n\n8. **Bake:**\n   - Preheat your oven to around 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C).\n   - Place the pie on a baking sheet to catch any drips and bake for about 45-60 minutes, or until the filling is bubbling and the crust is golden brown.\n\n9. **Cool:**\n   - Allow the pie to cool for several hours to let the filling set before serving.\n\nServe the"}, {"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/mm-vet-data/images218/161.jpg", "How to cook this dish?"], "generation": "The image you've provided looks like a homemade fruit pie, possibly a strawberry or mixed berry pie, with a lattice crust topping. Here is a general guide on how to prepare a similar fruit pie:\n\nIngredients:\n- Pie crust dough (homemade or store-bought)\n- 4-6 cups of fresh or frozen berries (strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, etc.)\n- 1/2 to 1 cup of granulated sugar (adjust based on the sweetness of the fruit)\n- 1/4 cup of cornstarch or all-purpose flour (for thickening)\n- 1 tablespoon of lemon juice\n- 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract (optional)\n- Pinch of salt\n- 2 tablespoons of butter, cut into small pieces\n- 1 egg, beaten (for egg wash)\n- Coarse sugar for sprinkling (optional)\n\nInstructions:\n\n1. Prepare the Pie Dough:\n   If you are making homemade pie dough, prepare and refrigerate it for at least 1 hour before rolling it out. If you are using a store-bought crust, follow the package instructions for bringing it to room temperature.\n\n2. Prepare the Filling:\n   In a large bowl, mix the berries, sugar, cornstarch or flour, lemon juice, vanilla (if using), and a pinch of salt until well combined. Let it sit for a few minutes to allow the berries to release some juices and the sugar to dissolve.\n\n3. Preheat the Oven:\n   Preheat your oven to 375\u00b0F (190\u00b0C) or according to your specific recipe's instructions.\n\n4. Assemble the Pie:\n   Roll out the bottom crust and place it into a 9-inch pie dish. Trim any overhanging dough. Fill the crust with the berry mixture and dot with pieces of butter.\n\n5. Lattice Crust Top:\n   Roll out the second piece of dough and cut it into strips for the lattice. Weave the strips over the top of the pie to create a lattice pattern. Trim any excess dough from the edges and crimp the lattice edges to seal with the bottom crust.\n\n6. Apply Egg Wash:\n   Beat the egg and brush it over the lattice crust and edges of the pie. This will help create a nice golden-brown finish. If desired, sprinkle the top with coarse sugar for added texture and sweetness.\n\n7.

Similar spending patterns are observable for Germany, though to a lesser extent, with amounts peaking just above the 160 thousand pound threshold. The British market also shows a strong preference for photographic film and toys, evidenced by expenditures that notably surpass those of France and Italy.\n\nFrance exhibits a balanced spending profile with consistent amounts dispersed across most categories, with a slight bias towards spending on toys which approach the 160 thousand pound mark. Italy presents a contrast with relatively less variability, most evidently in their reduced spending on CDs and tennis racquets, yet an inclination to invest in photographic film, where their spending nears the level displayed by Britain.\n\nGermany demonstrates a somewhat polarized spending behavior, with significant investments in personal stereos and toys, comparable to the high levels observed in Britain. However, Germany's spending on CDs, perfumes, and tennis racquets ranks the lowest among the four nations.\n\nTo summarize, expenditure on personal stereos in Britain and Germany outshine other categories and countries.

Crop Rotation: Avoid planting cabbages or related crops in the same soil where the disease has occurred for at least two to three years.\n2. Clean Cultivation: Remove and destroy infected plants and debris from the field to reduce the sources of infection for future crops.\n3.

A common disease that affects cabbage and other brassicas is clubroot, caused by a soil-borne organism called Plasmodiophora brassicae. Clubroot results in swollen, distorted roots that can ultimately stunt plant growth and reduce yield. Symptoms above ground can include yellowing of leaves and stunted growth, but the diagnosis is usually confirmed by examining the roots.\n\nHowever, the specific disease or condition affecting the cabbage in the image could be something else entirely, as other diseases and nutrient deficiencies can cause similar symptoms. A diagnosis requires a closer examination of the plant, its root system, and the environmental conditions in which it is growing.\n\nTo treat diseases in cabbages and other plants:\n\n1. Diagnosis: Accurate diagnosis is essential for effective treatment. If a pathogen such as a fungus, bacterium, or virus is responsible, samples may need to be sent to a laboratory for confirmation.\n\n2. Cultural Controls: Implementing good cultural practices can often help manage disease. These include rotating crops to prevent soil-borne diseases, ensuring adequate spacing for air circulation, and maintaining proper nutrient levels and soil pH.\n\n3. Chemical Controls: Fungicides and other pesticides can be used to treat or prevent certain diseases, though they should be used judiciously and in accordance with local regulations and guidelines.\n\n4. Resistant Varieties: Planting disease-resistant cabbage varieties can help prevent the occurrence of certain diseases.\n\n5. Soil Treatment: For diseases like clubroot, treating the soil with lime to reduce acidity can help because the clubroot pathogen thrives in acidic soil conditions.\n\n6. Sanitation: Removing and destroying infected plant material can help prevent the spread of disease.\n\nAlways take precautions to prevent the spread of disease to other plants and follow any treatment with continued monitoring for effectiveness.

It thrives in wet, cool conditions, and is caused by the oomycete organisms such as Peronospora parasitica. Alternaria leaf spot shows up as small black or brown spots that enlarge over time. Black rot, caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris, is another possibility, and it typically presents as V-shaped yellowing or browning patches at the margins of the leaves.\n\nTreatment and management of plant diseases often involve a combination of practices:\n\n1.
