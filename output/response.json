The infection causes a white, powdery growth on the surface of the leaves, which can reduce the plant's photosynthetic capacity and reduce yield.\n\nTo treat powdery mildew, the affected plants should be removed from the infected area and disposed of properly to prevent further spread of the disease. The remaining plants should be treated with fungicides, which can be applied as a foliar spray or soil drench. Fungicides used for powdery mildew control include sulfur, copper, and azole compounds such as chlorothalonil and iprodione. It is important to follow the instructions for the specific fungicide used, as improper use can result in increased resistance to the fungicide and reduced effectiveness.\n\nPreventative measures can also be taken to reduce the risk of powdery mildew infections, including planting resistant varieties, providing good air circulation, and avoiding overhead irrigation.

The Godfather also features strong performances from Robert Duvall, James Caan, and Diane Keaton.\n\nOverall, The Godfather is a powerful and influential film that remains a cultural touchstone decades after its release.
