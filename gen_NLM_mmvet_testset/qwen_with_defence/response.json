Cabbage worm disease is caused by the larvae of cabbage worms, which feed on the leaves of cabbage plants. The disease can significantly reduce the yield and quality of cabbage crops.\n\nTo treat cabbage worm disease, it is recommended to use organic methods such as introducing natural predators to the garden, such as ladybugs and lacewings, which can help control cabbage worm populations. Additionally, applying organic pesticides like pyrethrin or rotenone can also help manage the infestation. It is important to monitor the cabbage plants regularly and apply pesticides as soon as the symptoms of the disease are noticed to prevent the spread of the infestation."

One common method is to apply a fungicide to the infected area. Another method is to remove the infected plant parts and treat the soil with a fungicide. In some cases, pruning the infected branch or even removing the entire plant may be necessary. It is important to note that treating the disease early on can help prevent its spread and ensure the health of the plant."
