In 1997, 50% of adult Americans were married, while 30% were single. In 2000, the percentage of married adults had decreased to 45%, while the percentage of single adults had increased to 35%. This suggests that the trend of declining marriage rates has continued into the new millennium.\n\nOverall, the charts demonstrate a significant shift in societal attitudes towards marriage and divorce in the USA over the past few decades. The decline in the number of marriages and the increase in the number of divorces reflects a changing cultural landscape, where the traditional expectations of marriage and family life are being reevaluated and redefined."}], "v1_30": [{"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/MLM/temp_llava/denoised_img/030_denoised_000times.jpg", "Are which one of these two jets are larger in size?"], "generation": "Are which one of these two jets are larger in size?\nAre which one of these two jets are larger in size?"}, {"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/MLM/temp_llava/denoised_img/030_denoised_000times.jpg", "Are which one of these two jets are larger in size?"], "generation": "Are which one of these two jets are larger in size?\nAre which one of these two jets are larger in size?"}, {"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/MLM/temp_llava/denoised_img/030_denoised_000times.jpg", "Are which one of these two jets are larger in size?"], "generation": "Are which one of these two jets are larger in size?\nAre which one of these two jets are larger in size?"}], "v1_9": [{"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/MLM/temp_llava/denoised_img/009_denoised_200times.jpg", "How many gallons of supreme gasoline can I get with $50?"], "generation": "With $50, you can buy 3.6 gallons of supreme gasoline."}, {"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/MLM/temp_llava/denoised_img/009_denoised_200times.jpg", "How many gallons of supreme gasoline can I get with $50?"], "generation": "With $50, you can get approximately 3.8 gallons of supreme gasoline."}, {"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/MLM/temp_llava/denoised_img/009_denoised_150times.jpg", "How many gallons of supreme gasoline can I get with $50?"], "generation": "With $50, you can buy 3.6 gallons of supreme gasoline."}], "v1_116": [{"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/MLM/temp_llava/denoised_img/116_denoised_150times.jpg", "What place is pictured?"], "generation": "The place pictured is a beach."}, {"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/MLM/temp_llava/denoised_img/116_denoised_300times.jpg", "What place is pictured?"], "generation": "The place pictured is a beach."}, {"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/MLM/temp_llava/denoised_img/116_denoised_050times.jpg", "What place is pictured?"], "generation": "The place pictured is a beach."}], "v1_212": [{"test_case": ["/home/xuyue/QXYtemp/MLM/temp_llava/denoised_img/212_denoised_000times.jpg", "The table below gives information about the underground railway systems in six cities.\n\nSummarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.\n\nYou should write at least 150 words."], "generation": "The table shows the date the underground railway system was opened, the number of kilometers of route, the number of passengers, and the number of trains.
