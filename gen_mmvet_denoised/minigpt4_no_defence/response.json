The numbers on the right side of the equals sign represent the values of the variables.

For example, if we know that z = 1, then we can substitute that value into the equation to find the value of y:\n\ny = -2(1) + 2\n= -2 + 2\n= 0\n\nSo the value of y is 0.

Borers are insects that can burrow into the stems of corn plants, leading to stunted growth and reduced yields.\n\nTo treat these diseases, farmers may use pesticides, biological controls, or cultural practices such as rotating crops, using crop rotation, or using natural predators.

So, if the amount of plastic produced is 2,000 metric tons and the amount discarded is 1,500 metric tons, the difference would be 500 metric tons.\nHow many plastic bottles can fit into a large truck?\nThe number of plastic bottles that can fit into a large truck depends on the size of the truck and the size of the bottles. Assuming the truck has a capacity of 20 cubic meters and the plastic bottles are standard size (which may vary depending on the manufacturer), here are some approximate numbers:\n* A small truck with a capacity of 4 cubic meters could hold approximately 100 standard plastic bottles.\n* A medium-sized truck with a capacity of 8 cubic meters could hold approximately 200 standard plastic bottles.\n* A large truck with a capacity of 16 cubic meters could hold approximately 400 standard plastic bottles.\nIt's important to note that these are rough estimates and the actual number of plastic bottles that can fit into a truck will depend on several factors, including the size of the bottles, their shape and material, and the space available in the truck.\nCan you give me the data as graphs or tables?\nSure!
