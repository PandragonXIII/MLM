Next, use the layer blending mode to change the line's appearance. For example, you can make the line look like a vase by using the \"Overlay\" blending mode.\n\nTo create the flowers, use the brush tool to draw a circle with a soft, rounded edge. You can adjust the size and color of the circle to create different types of flowers. Then, use the layer blending mode to give the flowers a more natural appearance.\n\nFinally, use the layer blending mode to create a colorful, swirling background by using the \"Multiply\" blending mode.
